Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software Engineering is the process of creating, developing, deploying, maintaining and testing the systematic application that will solve the real life problems using and adhering software engennering principles, tools and methods.  

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software engineering is a discipline that specialise and interested on the systematic approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of developed or developing software systems. 

Software engineering difers from Traditional programming because is disciplined and comprehensive approach in developing software that goes beyond mere coding, While Traditional Programming focuses on creating codes that will only solve specific problem it is not versitile. 
   

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Requirements: this phase it focuses in gathering and documenting user's needs and the system requirements to develop solutions. 
- Design: At this phase develop design software architecture and user interface, developer have to decide how will the user starts to use the application eg Logins or menu and etc.
- Implementation: At this phase developer comes up with code that will develop application, according to the specification. 
- Testing: at this phase developer is verifying and validating the software to ensure that specified requirement are met and it functions correctly. 
- Deloyment: At this phase developed software is deployed to the production environment for end-user to access and utilize after software has been throughly tested and approved so that end-user can install.  
- Maintenance: At this phase software is being monitored, updated, maintained continuously to address bugs and new features are added, perfomance is enhanced.

Agile model: 

-"Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development.
-It emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and delivering working software in short iterations called sprints".
-"Requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of cross-functional teams".
-"There is continuous feedback and adaptation throughout the development process".
-"Agile methods include Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), etc"

Waterfall Model:

-'Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to software development'.
-"It follows a fixed sequence of phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance) with minimal overlap or iteration".
-"Each phase must be completed before moving to the next, and changes are difficult to accommodate once a phase is finished".
-"It is well-suited for projects with stable requirements and where the entire scope can be defined upfront".
-"However, it can be less flexible and adaptive to changing requirements compared to Agile".


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:


-Iterative and Incremental: Agile is based on an iterative and incremental approach, where the software is developed in small increments over short periods called sprints.
-Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile allows for flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements throughout the development process. Requirements are not fixed upfront and can evolve through collaboration with stakeholders.
-Customer Collaboration: Agile emphasizes customer collaboration and feedback, ensuring that the software meets the customer's needs and expectations.
-Cross-functional Teams: Agile teams are typically cross-functional, including developers, testers, designers, and stakeholders, who work closely together throughout the project.
-Continuous Delivery: Agile promotes continuous delivery of working software at the end of each sprint, allowing for early and frequent releases.

Waterfall Model:

-Sequential and Linear: Waterfall follows a sequential and linear approach to software development, with distinct phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) that must be completed sequentially.
-Fixed Requirements: Waterfall requires detailed upfront planning and documentation of requirements, and changes to requirements are difficult to accommodate once the project has started.
-Minimal Customer Involvement: Waterfall typically involves minimal customer involvement during the development process, with requirements being finalized before development begins.
-Phased Delivery: Waterfall delivers the complete software solution at the end of the development lifecycle, rather than in incremental iterations.
-Well-suited for Stable Requirements: Waterfall is well-suited for projects with stable and well-understood requirements, where the entire scope can be defined upfront.

Key Differences: 

- Approach: Agile is flexible and iteractive, While Waterfall is rigid and sequential.
-Customer Involvement: On Agile customer collaboration is continuously encouranged. While Waterfall minimise customer involvement.
-Adaptability: Agile is open to any change and it can adapt to change, While Waterfall has less adaptation after development has took place. 
-Delivery?: Agile can deliver working software while development cycle is under contruction, While Waterfall can only provide solution once development cycle is complete.

Preferred Scenario:

-Agile: Can be use where there is no stable requirement, Flexibility, Collaboration where stakeholders will always be informed about new developments and improvement. 

-Waterfall: It is sutable for the project that has less flexibility and stable requirements, limited budget and Limited time. 

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

-Requirement engineering, is the process where developer is capturing, analyzing, documenting, and managing the requirements for software system. in this process developer also needs to understand stakeholders needs and expectations,translating them into a set of clear, precise, and verifiable requirements that can guide the development of the software.

Process of requirements Engineering:

- Elicitation: This is the begining of this process where developer is gathering the information about Stakeholder and End-users, then observe their needs, preferrences and constraints.
- Analysis: At the stage gathered information is analyzed to identify conflicts, inconsistencies and ambiguities. 
- Specification: In this step developer is documanting the requirements in a unambiguous, clear and structured manner.  
- Validation: When the requirements are specified, they are validated to ensure that they reflect expectations and needs of stkeholders this is to ensure requirements meet quality criteria and are feasible to implement. 
- Management: In software development lifecycle, requirements are managed to handle changes, trace dependencie, and ensure alignment with project goal. 

Importance of Requirements Engineering 

- Alignment with Stakeholder need:
- Risk Management 
- Cost and Test Efficiency 
- Quality Assurance
- Communication and Collaborating

Software Design Principles: 

- Modularity
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation 
- Separation of Concerns
- Single Responsibility principle
- Open/Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principles

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity: Is a design priciple that is associated with breaking down a software system into manageable, self-contained and smaller units called modules.

Manitainability 
-it isolates change so that when a bug is found new feature is added.
- it ensures thst there is easier understanding
- it simplefies testing, it simplies testing process
- it reduces the complexity by dividing they system into modules. 

Scalability

- it creates parallel Development so that team can work on different modules.
-it creates independent Scaling, Modules can be deployed or allocated to different or separated servers.
- it creates load distrubution, Workloeads can be distributed 
- it creates Modular Expansion. New features can be added without disturbing requirements. 

Testing in Software Engineering

-"Testing is a crucial part of software engineering that ensures the quality, functionality, and performance of the software".

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Levels of Software Testing

- Unit Testing: is to verify that every components or units of code funtion correctly.
- Integration Testing: is ensuring different modules or components of the software interact correctly
- System Testing: is to validating complete and integrated software system against the specified requrements.
- Acceptance Testing: is testing that confirm that the software meets business requirements and is ready for delivery. 

Importance of testing in Software Development:

Testing is importatnt in software development for differenet and several reasons: 
- Quality Assurance 
- Bug Detection 
- Requirement Validation
- User Satisfaction 
- Risk Mitigation
- Regulatory Compliance
- Performance Optimization

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version Control Systems: Are tools that helps developers to manage any changes to source code over time, and it also allows more then one developers to collaborate in developing one project by keeping track of every modification made to the codebase. 

Importance of Version Control Systems:

- Collaboration: they allow more than one develop on one project.
- History Tracking: it records every change is made on codebase for future refers.
- Backup: they use repository to backup the entire project. 
- Branching and Merging: it allows developer to creates for every new features or experiments without affecting initial main codebase. 
- Version Management: "Developers can tag specific points in the history as versions (releases), making it easy to manage and deploy different versions of the software".
- Conflict Resolution: it provides tools to resolve conflict, and ensuring the final code is correct and consistent, when multiple change is made on the same part of the code. 


Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
